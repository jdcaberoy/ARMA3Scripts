:apmlogo2: OPORD
The recent attack on out convoy  gave us permission to patrol the concerned area and investigate. The checkpoint near Dorida may be a good start. However, the local government has ordered no armed vehicles
to go in or near the town to prevent panic.
HQ has advised discretion in handling this incident.

Time: Day
